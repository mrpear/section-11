  Wk 2: mean EF 1.45, 4 qualifying
  Wk 3: mean EF 1.48, 4 qualifying
  Wk 4: mean EF 1.50, 2 qualifying
  Block trend: improving

Wellness (block avg vs previous block):
  HRV: 53 ms (prev block: 51 ms) ↑ improving
  RHR: 49 bpm (prev block: 50 bpm) → stable — no concern
  Sleep: 7.1h (prev block: 6.8h) ↑ improving
  Avg RI: 0.91 (prev block: 0.87)

Section 11 Flags During Block:
  Wk 3 Thu: HRV 12% below baseline → modified VO2max session (removed
  final interval). HRV recovered by Saturday. No further action needed.

Phase Progression Check:
  Block objective: Build threshold power, improve aerobic efficiency
  Criteria met: Yes
    - CTL target of 80 reached (actual: 80.1)
    - Long ride decoupling improved to <3%
    - Sweetspot and VO2max power targets both hit
    - Compliance >85% (actual: 96%)
    - No sustained wellness decline
  Phase recommendation: Progress to Peak/Race Specificity
  Rationale: All phase progression criteria met. eFTP trending up (+11W)
  suggests FTP test will confirm improvement. Aerobic base is solid
  (decoupling 2.1% over 4.5h). Athlete is ready for race-specific work.

Assessment:
Textbook threshold block. CTL rose 8.9 points at a sustainable 1.12/week
ramp — well within the <1.5 guideline. Both key performance markers hit
targets, with VO2max power exceeding by 7W. The standout metric is long
ride decoupling dropping from 4.8% to 2.1% — the aerobic engine is
building nicely, confirmed by the aggregate durability trend improving
steadily across all four weeks (3.2% → 1.8%). Efficiency Factor tracked
upward in parallel (1.42 → 1.50), reinforcing the aerobic fitness gains. Grey zone stayed well
controlled throughout, with only a minor creep in week 3 (4.2%) during
peak load. TID held Polarized at block scale (PI 3.05). One flag
triggered in week 3 but was handled correctly with a session modification.
Deload week brought TSB back to +28, athlete enters next block fresh.

Next Block Plan:
  Phase: Peak / Race Specificity
  Duration: 3 weeks + taper
  Focus: Race-pace intervals, over-unders, sustained threshold efforts
  Key changes: Replace sweetspot with over-under intervals, add
    race-simulation efforts on long rides, reduce total volume ~10%
  Targets: FTP test week 1 (expect 282-287W based on eFTP trend),
    CTL maintenance 78-82, race-ready TSB of +15-25 by target date
```

  Wk 4: mean EF N/A, 0 qualifying (illness)
  Wk 5: mean EF 1.41, 2 qualifying

Wellness (block avg vs previous block):

  Sleep: 6.4h (prev block: 7.1h) ↓ declining — monitor
  Avg RI: 0.79 (prev block: 0.91)

Section 11 Flags During Block:
  Wk 3 Thu: HRV >15% below baseline → rest day inserted
  Wk 3: Grey Zone >5% → pacing review (fatigue-related drift)
  Wk 3: Durability declining — 5.1% mean dec vs 2.5% wk 1 → fatigue impact on aerobic efficiency
  Wk 4: 3 consecutive missed sessions → illness protocol activated
  Wk 4: CTL drop >3 points in 1 week → load management flag
  Wk 5: Return-to-training protocol → reduced intensity for 5 days
  Block: TID shifted from Polarized (wk 1-2) to Pyramidal at block scale (PI 1.90) → illness reduced quality volume

Phase Progression Check:
  Block objective: Continue aerobic base development, maintain CTL ~82
  Criteria met: No
    - CTL dropped from 80.1 to 77.1 (target was maintenance/growth)
    - Compliance below 85% threshold (actual: 80%)
    - Illness disrupted weeks 3-4
    - Sweetspot power regressed
    - HRV has not returned to pre-block baseline
    - Durability regressed (wk 3 mean 5.1% vs wk 1-2 avg 2.65%)
    - Block-scale TID dropped to Pyramidal (PI 1.90)
  Phase recommendation: Extend Base phase — do NOT progress to Build
  Rationale: Illness cost ~2 weeks of productive training and fitness
  markers have not recovered to pre-block levels. Progressing to higher
  intensity with suppressed HRV, reduced CTL, and regressed durability
  risks further setback. Next block should rebuild to block entry CTL
  and restore aerobic efficiency before advancing.

Assessment:
A disrupted block. Weeks 1-2 were tracking well — strong compliance,
good polarization, CTL rising on target, durability solid at 2.5-2.8%.
The mid-block illness (week 3-4) cost approximately 2 weeks of productive
training and 5 CTL points at the nadir. Durability spiked to 5.1% in
week 3 as fatigue set in before the illness fully manifested — the
aggregate decoupling trend caught the problem before wellness metrics
crashed in week 4. Return-to-training in week 5 was handled
conservatively, which was the right call — durability partially recovered
(3.8%) but hasn't returned to pre-illness levels. The block-scale TID
shifting to Pyramidal (PI 1.90) reflects the loss of quality volume
during weeks 3-5. Key concern: HRV has dropped 11% block-over-block
and hasn't recovered, suggesting the body is still processing the illness.
FTP test postponed until wellness and durability stabilize.

Next Block Plan:
  Phase: Aerobic Base (rebuild)
  Duration: 3 weeks
  Focus: Restore CTL to 80+, normalize wellness markers, rebuild
    aerobic efficiency before any intensity progression
  Key changes: Cap intensity at tempo (no VO2max until HRV baseline
    restored), prioritize sleep hygiene, reduce weekly hours by ~10%
    vs pre-illness levels, gradually reintroduce long ride duration
  Targets: CTL >80 by end of block, HRV avg >50ms (pre-illness
    baseline), RHR <50 bpm, long ride decoupling back to <3%,
    durability 7d mean <3%. Reassess phase progression at block end.

## Notes

- **Example 1** shows a clean, successful block — all criteria met, clear progression
- **Example 2** shows how the template handles real-world disruption — illness, regression, and the protocol's decision to NOT progress
- **Polarization by Week** caught the grey zone creep in Example 2 that the block average partially masked
- **Durability by Week** caught the aerobic efficiency regression in Example 2 before wellness metrics crashed — the aggregate trend is a leading indicator of fatigue
- **Week-by-week CTL** in Volume Progression tells the trajectory story — Example 2's dip-and-partial-recovery is immediately visible
- **Phase Progression Check** is the most important section — it makes the coaching decision transparent and auditable
- **Wellness labels** ("declining — flag" vs "declining — monitor") give actionable context, not just arrows
- Block reports should be the longest report type (45-60 lines) — this is where comprehensive analysis is warranted
